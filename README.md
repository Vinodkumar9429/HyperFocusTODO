# A ToDo App that'll help you to focus properly on one thing at a time

## Stack : 
HTML TailwindCSS TypeScript + Vite

## More about the project : 
This ToDo app is useful when you want to solely focus on least amount of tasks possible without getting exhausted of juggling here and there.
The tasks are to be completed in a priority order where the top one is to be completed first and so on, to help help you finish the big things in the mornings when the focus is usually sharp.
Used TailwindCSS to style, it is blazing fast to cut through that styling phase, responsive ? clean ? stylish + modern ? I'll Pick tailwind for that anyday.
Used Typescript here as a way to get familiar with it when I start react with Typescript.
